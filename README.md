# TourfirmaSystem
This is my project for "IT Technologies" discipline.
The main goal was about development of the full-stack skills.
Backend was made on Django, frontend was made on React, sqlite3 is chosen by default for Django framework.
There are four roles: common user, touroperator, manager and administrator.
Common user can leave its phone number with city's name, then he waits for recall.
Touroperator can book hotel rooms in certain inn.
Manager can accept\reject booking query that goes from touroperator.
Administrator have the ability to add or remove inns from the site.
